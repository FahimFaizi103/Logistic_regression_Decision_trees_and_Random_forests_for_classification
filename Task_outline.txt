 example, when a Lead Designer of a major fashion brand has picked the colo=
ur for the season, he/she would want the exact colour on the produced garme=
nts. This means all hundreds of thousands of garments need to have the same=
 colour. This is challenging because there are so many factors affecting co=
lour: for example, different materials (e.g. cotton, polyester, leather) ha=
ve different dye absorption rate; water properties (pH, purity, etc); ambie=
nt temperature; dyes concentration; chemical properties; etc.



One of the key reasons why this company has become one of the leading players in t=
he Apparel and Footwear Industry is because our colour solution cracks t=
his issue. Every year, the company dyes over one billion SKUs (Stock Keeping Unit=
s) into 157,000 unique colours. And most of the time, we get the colour rig=
ht first time.



However, one of our dye-houses has a higher fail =
rate. The head of the dye-house has asked the Data Science team wheth=
er it is possible to predict batches which are most likely to fail, so that=
 they can take a range of pre-emptive actions.

You are member of our data science team. We have scheduled a meeting in =
one week's time with the head of the dye-house in which you will pres=
ent our findings of the failed dyes issue.



You are in charge of building the model and to establish the viability of s=
uch a model: For training your model you are provided with a dataset which =
includes features of dyed batches as well as the information about whether =
or not they have failed. Also while it is not mandatory, you are encouraged=
 to test multiple algorithms.


Using the trained model you shall score batches in the test data set =
and put them in descending order of the probability of failing. You should =
also classify these batches into two classes: those which you predict to fa=
il are to be labelled "Fail" and the remaining batches should be labelled "=
Pass" in the test.template file
